<h2>Data structure and algorithms</h2>
<p>This repository will give an basic idea of the most common data structure using Javascript.</p>

<strong>
    <p>Here we will see the Dynamic Data Structure.</p>
</strong>

<ul>
    <li> <strong> What are Dynamic Data Structure. : <br> </strong>
        Data structure in which the size is not fixed, size can be randomly updated during the runtime is know as the
        Dynamic Data Structure.

        <h4><strong>Types of Dynamic Data Structure : </strong></h4>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Stack : </strong> A stack is a simple data structure that allows data to be stored and retrieved in a particular order. It works like a stack of books where the last book added is the first one to be taken out.</li>
    <li><strong>Queue : </strong> A queue is a linear data structure that follows the principle of FIFO (First In, First Out). This means that the first element added to the queue is the first element to be removed from the queue.</li>
