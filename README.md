<h2>Data structure and algorithms</h2>
<p>This repository will give an basic idea of the common data structure using Javascript.</p>

    <p>Detalied explanation to all the data structure have been given in their particular folder.</p>

## What are data structure

In simple words, a data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. It provides a way to represent and manipulate data in a logical and organized manner, making it easier to perform operations like searching, sorting, and modifying the data

## Types of DS

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data structure] --> B(Linear)
    A[Data structure] --> C(Non-Linear)
    B[Linear DS] --> D(Static DS)
    B[Linear DS] --> E(Dyamic DS)
    D[Static DS] --> H(Array)
    E[Dynamic DS] --> I(Queue)
    E[Dynamic DS] --> J(Stack)
    E[Dynamic DS] --> K(Linked List)
    C[Non Linear DS] --> F(Tree)
    C[Non Linear DS] --> G(Graph)
```
