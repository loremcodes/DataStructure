## Introduction
Data structures and algorithms are essential concepts in computer science and software development. They play a crucial role in solving complex problems efficiently, optimizing code, and creating robust applications. This repository serves as a resource for learning and understanding these fundamental concepts.

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Choose the programming language you are comfortable with (e.g., Python, Java, C++, etc.).
- Explore the tutorials and implementations of various data structures and algorithms.
- Feel free to experiment, modify, and learn from the code provided.

## Data Structures
In the data_structures directory, you will find various implementations of common data structures, including but not limited to:

Array
Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
Stack
Queue
Graph

Each data structure comes with its own tutorial explaining its working principles, operations, and use cases. You can find the corresponding implementation in the Go programming language.

Algorithms
In the Algorithm directory, you will find implementations of popular algorithms, such as:

Searching algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)
Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)

Similarly, each algorithm is accompanied by a tutorial explaining its logic, time complexity, and practical use cases. The code is available in Golang programming language.

Contributing
We welcome contributions from the open-source community. If you find any bugs, errors, or improvements, please feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request. Your valuable contributions will help improve the content and make it more helpful to learners worldwide.

When contributing, please follow the existing code style and ensure that your changes are well-documented. Also, add appropriate tests to verify the correctness of your implementations.
